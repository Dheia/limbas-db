=== QUICKINSTALL =======================================================

- Limbas Server only works on Unix Systems like Linux or BSD
- you need at least apache with php and unixodbc support for used database or build-in odbc driver if supported from php. (for PostgreSQL use "postgreSQL ODBC" driver, not "unixodbc Driver for PostgreSQL")
- extract the complete LIMBAS package (not only the source) to an available apache web directory
- make directory "/dependent" recursive writable for apacheuser
- be shure the symbolic links are correct set from "limbas_src" to "dependent" directory
- call up the setup script in [INSTALLPATH]/dependent/admin/install/index.php
- fill in the formular and select the empty database (clean) or demo database (demo) then press install
