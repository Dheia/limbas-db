=== QUICKINSTALL =======================================================

- Limbas Server only works on Unix Systems like Linux or BSD. Windows Server was not supported but should work with some adjustments.
- you need at least apache with php and PDO support for used database. (PDO is only supported for PostgreSQl and MySQL. For other databases use installation with ODBC)
- if ODBC needed you need unixodbc support for used database or build-in odbc driver if supported from php. (for PostgreSQL use "postgreSQL ODBC" driver, not "unixodbc Driver for PostgreSQL")
- you cannot use ODBC and PDO module simultaneously
- extract the complete LIMBAS package (not only the source) to an available apache web directory
- make directory "/dependent" recursive writable for apacheuser
- be shure the symbolic links are correct set from "limbas_src" to "dependent" directory
- call up the setup script in [INSTALLPATH]/dependent/admin/install/setup.php
- fill in the formular and select the empty database (clean) or demo database (demo) then press install
- the root path to limbas is always [INSTALLPATH]/dependent/

=== UPDATE =======================================================

update
- download latest "LIMBAS source"
- replace or add the new LIMBAS source directory "limbas_src_x.x"
- rebuild the symlink "limbas_src" to the new source directory (ln -s limbas_src_x.x limbas_src)
- login to limbas - limbas will redirect you to the "system update page" - select the Systemupdate script "up_x.x.php" and run the update with "OK". If your release is older than one release you have to run all updates up to your release.
- go to the root directory ([INSTALLPATH]/dependent/) and reset your system 
- replace the "independent" directory with its newest version if necessary. Available as "independent.tar" archive or over subversion.
